HTML - HyperText Markup Language

HTML is made up of elements, which are the building blocks of web pages.

example of an element: <title> Document </title>


An elements consists of a start/opening tag, content, and an end/closing tag.

Between an opening and closing tag, you can put text, images, links, and other elements.

Some elements are self-closing, meaning they do not have a closing tag, like the <img> element.


Within the opening tag, you can add attributes to provide additional information about the element.

attribute_name="attribute_value"
